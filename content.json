I am using genymotion so I need to do some install before install google play: Install ARM Translation,download Genymotion-ARM-Translation_v1.1zip,then drag and drop the downloaded file to an opened Genymotion virtual device. After file transfering is done, there will be a confirmation dialog ,just click OK all the way. You need to reboot the virtual device now but we don’t suggest to just close the virtual device and relaunch it once again since it may leads to some weird behaviour.. First we need to reboot the device. cd C:\\Users[yourUserName]\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\sdk\\platform-tools1adb reboot Now close the device and restart it againIn case you accidentally close the virtual device, don’t be panic. You might need to relaunch for a few times before it can boot up. Install gapps. download the flashable zip of gapps by your virtual device’s Android version:Android 5.0.x, Android 4.4.x, Android 4.3.x, Android 4.2.x, Android 4.1.x, Android 4.0.x, Android 2.3.3 and thendrag and drop the downloaded file to the virtual device and like before reboot the device. “Google Play services has stopped” will keep popping. don’t worry. just go to google play and update all apps.
