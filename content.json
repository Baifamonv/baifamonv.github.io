I love it! A little about me My name is Jing Chen and I am about to start my fourth year of computer science at Concordia University. I love dancing and could be very addicted to read Chinese novels. I love web application. Right now I am learning and practing developing web application by laravel/homestead, git, wordpress, forge and digital ocean.Now I could confidently automate the process of local test-git version control and server update. Also it’s my first github page powered by Hexo and theme by PPOffice. I guess I would stay here long time and share my experice. Most of important of all, I am learning Active.js which is amazing library.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"markdown","slug":"markdown","permalink":"https://baifamonv.github.io/tags/markdown/"}]}]}
